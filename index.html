    <h1>Chapter 2 :History</h1>
    <p>
    The 2024 kenya maandamano aka.the gen-z apprising come forth due to the finance bill of 2024 which was read in the parliament of kenya by the respective representatives.
    <br>
    so the Kenyan gen-zs felt oppresed by the bill and since the leaders were not willing to listen to the cries of the citizens they decided to take the action in their hands and go for the streets.
    <br>
    this led to a series of events that were not really pretty e.g loss of lives, security bridge,destruction of property,economy drop down among others.
